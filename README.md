- 👋 Hi, I’m @AmbyrZone, or IRL Bryan Ambrose but just "Ambrose" is fine.
- 👀 I’m semi-retired now and interested in spending some time learning new programming languages. 
- :steam_locomotive: I used to hobby program a long time ago but I seriously need to update my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning several newer (to me) languages like Python, Ruby, Julia, and x86-64 Assembly. Not necessarily in that order.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the future but first I want to learn how to correctly use Git as part of a team.
- 📫 How to reach me: Either ping me here or email me at **ambyrzone ⓐ outlook 🞘 com** (expect _slow_ response times).
